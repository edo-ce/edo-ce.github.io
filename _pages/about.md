Hi!

My name is Edoardo, and I'm a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Trento, where I'm doing research under the supervision of [Prof. Giuseppe Riccardi](https://disi.unitn.it/~riccardi/). My research interests are in LLMs, Vision-Language models, and dialogue systems.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree from Ca' Foscari University of Venice, where I wrote my thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Agostino Cortesi](https://www.unive.it/data/people/5591776).
